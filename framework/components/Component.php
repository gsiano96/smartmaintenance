/**
 * Class Component.
 *
 * The MVC Component class is an abstraction for a set of specialized components.
 * A component is an entity that implements some common and generalized behaviours
 * recurring during web application development. Sometimes these behaviours are well
 * known as "aspects" and, for example, some of these are: record pagination, table sorting,
 * record submission and so on.
 * Components may also have a GUI interface which is designed into an external HTML file
 * (that acts as template for the user interface) which is itself managed by a View object.
 * By default many graphic components are provided with a predefined GUI HTML template. User
 * can also replace a predefined template with a custom one that codes a custom graphic
 * experience.* It's important that a User, by replacing a default HTML template, must take
 * care to reproduce all BLOCKS and PLACEHOLDERS designed into the default one.
 * Finally User can bind the component's GUI into a special placeholder placed inside a View
 * template. This placeholder has the following format:
 *              {ComponentType:ComponentInstanceName}
